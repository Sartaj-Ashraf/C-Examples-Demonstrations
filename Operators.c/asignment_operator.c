Assignment Operator

The assignment operator is one of the most important operators in any programming language,
 it assigns the value of the right-handed expression, variable, 
 and value (constant value) to the left side variable. Remember variable
must be on the left side of the assignment operator.

variableName = expression;

int num;
num = 123;        /*Will assign 123 to num*/
num = 10+20; /* Will assign the result of expression 10+20  to num*/
